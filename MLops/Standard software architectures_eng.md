# Standard architectures 

---

There are several standard software architectures, each with its own strengths and suitable use cases. Understanding these architectures can help in choosing the right design for a given application.

1. **Monolithic Architecture**:
   - **Description**: In a monolithic architecture, the entire application is built as a single, unified unit. This includes the user interface, business logic, and data access all bundled together and deployed as a single entity.
   - **Use Case**: It is ideal for smaller to medium-sized applications where simplicity and ease of deployment are prioritized.
   - **Examples**: Traditional web applications or desktop applications where all functionalities are tightly coupled within a single executable or server application.

2. **Client-Server Architecture**:
   - **Description**: This architecture divides the application into two main components: the client (frontend) and the server (backend). The client sends requests to the server, which processes these requests and sends back responses.
   - **Use Case**: Commonly used for web applications and networked applications where the client interacts with the server over a network.
   - **Examples**: A web application with a React frontend (client-side) and a Node.js backend (server-side).
   - **Reference**: [Client-Server Architecture](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/client-server)

3. **Microservices Architecture**:
   - **Description**: Microservices architecture breaks down an application into a collection of small, independent services, each responsible for a specific piece of functionality. These services communicate via APIs and can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.
   - **Use Case**: Suitable for large-scale, distributed applications that require flexibility and independent scaling of components.
   - **Examples**: Companies like Amazon and Netflix use microservices to handle complex, large-scale systems with numerous functionalities.

4. **Layered Architecture (N-tier Architecture)**:
   - **Description**: This architecture organizes the application into layers, such as presentation, business logic, and data access. Each layer has a distinct role and communicates with adjacent layers to perform its function.
   - **Use Case**: Common in enterprise applications where a clear separation of concerns and maintainability are required.
   - **Examples**: Model-View-Controller (MVC) applications where the model represents data, the view represents the user interface, and the controller manages the interaction between them.

5. **Event-Driven Architecture**:
   - **Description**: In an event-driven architecture, components or services communicate through events. When an event occurs, it triggers a response from other components or services. This architecture supports asynchronous communication and decoupling of services.
   - **Use Case**: Ideal for applications that require real-time processing or asynchronous operations.
   - **Examples**: IoT systems where devices communicate via events or financial trading platforms where transactions are processed in real-time.
   - **Reference**: [Event-Driven Architecture](https://www.ibm.com/topics/event-driven-architecture)

6. **Serverless Architecture**:
   - **Description**: Serverless architecture allows developers to build and run applications without managing server infrastructure. The cloud provider handles server management and scaling, allowing developers to focus on writing code.
   - **Use Case**: Suitable for applications that require scalable and cost-effective solutions without the overhead of managing servers.
   - **Examples**: AWS Lambda and Azure Functions, where code is executed in response to events or triggers.
   - **Reference**: [Serverless Architecture](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/)

7. **Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)**:
   - **Description**: SOA is similar to microservices but often involves larger services that may share data and have more complex interactions. It focuses on integrating various services to work together within an application.
   - **Use Case**: Best for systems that need to integrate multiple, often large-scale services.
   - **Examples**: Large-scale enterprise systems like ERP systems that integrate various business processes and services.
   - **Reference**: [Service-Oriented Architecture](https://www.oracle.com/enterprise-architecture/service-oriented-architecture/)

8. **Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Architecture**:
   - **Description**: In a P2P architecture, all nodes (peers) are equal and act as both clients and servers. There is no central server, and each peer can both provide and consume resources.
   - **Use Case**: Suitable for decentralized applications where every node contributes equally to the system.
   - **Examples**: File-sharing applications like BitTorrent or blockchain networks where nodes maintain and validate the distributed ledger.
   - **Reference**: [Peer-to-Peer Architecture](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/11834/peer-to-peer-p2p)

9. **Hexagonal Architecture (Ports and Adapters)**:
   - **Description**: Hexagonal architecture, also known as Ports and Adapters, focuses on making the core application logic independent of external systems like databases and user interfaces. It uses ports (interfaces) and adapters (implementations) to interact with external components.
   - **Use Case**: Ideal for applications that need to be adaptable to changes in external systems while maintaining a stable core business logic.
   - **Examples**: Applications that require easy adaptation to different databases, web services, or user interfaces.

10. **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**:
    - **Description**: Domain-Driven Design focuses on structuring the application around the core business domain. It aims to reflect real-world business processes and rules in the systemâ€™s architecture, creating a model that is closely aligned with business needs.
    - **Use Case**: Suitable for complex applications with evolving business requirements where domain modeling is crucial.
    - **Examples**: Enterprise software systems where understanding and modeling the business domain is key to success.

Each architecture offers unique advantages and is suited to different types of projects based on their scale, complexity, and specific needs.
